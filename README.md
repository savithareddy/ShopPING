About:

ShopPING is a simple and efficient shopping application with a easy to use interface.

What makes ShopPING unique?

	Its all about the PING and Simplicity. Many a times, just before/at shopping , you call up your family/group and ask if they need any items from the store. With them wanting some items, either you have to write down the list or keep them on call, till you complete shopping. To overcome this particular snag, a basic ShopPING app is developed.

Salient Features:

a.Maintain just one list.

b.Auto sync the list among your group.

c.Notify your group about your start/end shopping.

Description:

1.Login/SignUp:

	The user is required to sign up to the application with one unique group name for their family or group . This group name has to be verbally shared with your intended group. Email ID is required for future communication and support.
	
2.Item and List:

	Item is any entity that has to be purchased for you and your groupâ€™s daily necessities. Items can include anything from groceries, clothes, electronics, etc. Simplicity of maintaining only one list is the distinct feature. Default items are not provided, mainly because the user can create their own custom item list and maintain the same going forward. 
	List Features:
	a. Add - Enter the item name , description, number of them to be bought and metric of the item. The name and quantity fields are mandatory.
	b.Edit - Change any of the values as and when required.
	c.Delete- Three options for Delete are provided - single item delete, deleting all items in the list or delete only the checked items. 
	d. Sort- The item names can be sorted alphabetically.
	e. CheckBox- Once the item is shopped, just check the CheckBox on each item and this will move the item to the last in the list and the itemCount in the header is decremented by one. If you want any of the checked item to be shopped again,simply uncheck the checkBox and this action puts the item at the top of the list. 
	f. ItemCount - shows number of items that has to be shopped.
	
3.Sharing the List:

	Since all the users in a family or a group, share the same unique group name, each one of the list updates are available automatically in most cases and also when the user pulls the list down to refresh the list.
	
4.Notifications:
 
	Start Shopping sends information to all the users in your group telling them to update their list.At this point any user in your family/group can change any list features. The user who is shopping can inform all their family/group that shopping has ended and any items added now will not be shopped.
